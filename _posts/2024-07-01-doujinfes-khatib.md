Doujinfes Khatib turned out to be the last Doujinfes I would table at for the foreseeable future as I will be going on booth hiatus after Cosfest 2024. This event was also the last time I went maskless. As I kept getting sick this year, I decided to wear masks at events and see if it will make a difference.

As I had events every weekend of June, I took it easy for Doujinfes Khatib. I did not create any new merchandise for the event nor did any online marketing. When Doujinfes Tampines Safra first launched in September 2023, I was part of the artist alley there. After that, I also tabled at Doujinfes Bedok before landing at Doujinfes Khatib. I’m happy that more people are noticing and attending this event. Doujinfes is one of my favorite events to table at.

Doujinfes events are free entry and very spacious. There is always enough space to chill and relax with friends. As an exhibitor I especially enjoy the 1.8m tables that events hardly provide anymore. The booth lots are spacious and there is free water distributed throughout the map. This event also allows setting up on Fridays. I absolutely prefer this as it will be less hectic for me. Kudos to the Doujinfes team for proving such a wonderful tabling experience consistently!

Set up day, Friday. A minor mishap happened as The table was about 1 cm too small for my planned set up. I thought I would go big since table is big, but I was too ambitious😭 I wondered if I should just risk the wonky set up and return tomorrow with more panels to secure it. The set up collapsed before I even left, so I switched it back to my usual 3-panel set up. The atmosphere at set up day was very wholesome. I could hear friends chatting while setting up comfortably. There was plenty for time for people to discuss and replan their set ups.

The venue was a little cold. I couldn’t feel it on the first day since I was cosplaying Lightseeker and covered from top to bottom. Aki (Helper 1) was engrossed in manning the booth since she was determined to not spend money buying merchandise. I was able to stroll around with Courtney (Helper 2). We socialized, got burger king, and took some photos. Burger King is really our stable food at Doujinfes events. We made an impromptu decision to all cosplay Rafayel for one of my frequent customers. The day ended peacefully and we closed shop. Dinner was Saizeriya. (It was sad)

The next day, dressed as a kindergartener, I was freezing. I was wrapped up in the cloth I used to close shop and looked like I was lounging at home the whole day. I was able to run around and socialize a lot. The event was chill and we had a lot of times to talk and befriend customers. We also did a follow up “THIEF” photo with Courtney as thief. After closing shop, we headed to Junction 8 and had Genki Sushi for dinner.
