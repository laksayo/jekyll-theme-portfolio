Hello! First event, since the booth hiatus hehe. I was able to attend this event as a regular attendee instead of an exhibitor. This is such a rare experience. I had little to no baggage and was able to enjoy lunch at the mall before dropping by to support friends. I also toured the mall a little and got some snacks to hand out he he. (Not me hunting down the specific bunny milk candy so that I could give it out as Xavier) Without a booth, I got a friend to sign adoptions papers so that I wasn’t going to wander around lonely and sad :>

Lunch was Yakiniku. It was good, but we were seated opposite each other. We could hardly talk properly since the surroundings were loud, and if we were to lean in closer we would be cooking our faces. Then we went to donki, daiso and every other snack shop in the mall before heading over to the con. It was so hot on the way and at the venue…

Heard from boothing friends that the event was great, comparable to AFA CSF, and way better than cosfest :) Saw the iconic banana man. They even have a booth selling bananas now. 🫨 Distributed bunny candy to friends and everyone who came up for photos. Had a nice time chatting and catching up with friends, fooling around and taking some photos. Is this what everyone does as a regular attendee? I left before the sun set, and it was the first time I left an event so early. Hehe. That was fun, maybe I will show up at cosverse next week too.

The post is a little short, I think it’s because I was out for a shorter period of time than usual :>

I also came home earlier to my extended family in full cosplay /weep.
