Anime Garden 2025 was once again held at Gardens by the Bay. Learning from last year’s experience, I decided against cosplaying in the hot weather and prepared hand held fans to stay cool. At this point of time, I was already more seasoned with tabling alone. I arrived at around 10 am to set up my table and chatted with my booth neighbor who had specifically flown from Indonesia for this event. I was impressed that he was able to fly to carry his merchandise and fly to another country to table at a convention alone. He said that he have been doing this for a couple of years and he really enjoys tabling at events by AFA. He encouraged me to try flying out of the country for my future booths as well.

I made plans with Milky to come and help me out during the event. As we had shared a table at the previous convention at Kallang Leisure Park, she was familiar with my items and how my booth is run. We were able to keep ourselves entertained by joking around all day and could take turns getting food, water and relieving ourselves. By coincidence, the booth on the other side turned out to be the booth that was next to us at Kallang Leisure Park. We marveled over the coincidence and chatted with her for a bit.

Friends visited us and chat with us throughout the day. Friends dropped by and gave us gifts. There was even hand made bracelets. We had Shake Shack on the first day and Tsuta on the second day. Milky and I were proud ipad owners who used them as food trays. As the event features a outdoor night concert, we were obliged to stay until 10pm. Despite looking forward to hearing snippets of the concert, the booth was a little too far away and we could not hear the concert from our position. Instead, we witnessed the supergrowth’s regular light show performance.

As the table was in an outdoor setting, I packed up my booth and took all my items home before setting up again the next day. My baggage for tabling at conventions was really getting more and more and I was about to reach my physical limit lugging them to and from events. As the event was stuffy, I had decided to remove my mask and go maskless for the 2 days. Unfortunately, I fell sick after the event. I learnt my lesson that I had to remain masked during events as I will come into close contact with lots of people and I was prone to getting sick. Overall it was a chill and cozy event and I was able to spend most of my time chatting with friends.
