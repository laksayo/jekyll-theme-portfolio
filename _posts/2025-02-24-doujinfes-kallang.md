Hello! I tabled at Doujinfes hosted at Kallang Leisure Park over the weekend, 22 - 23 February. Unlike previous years, we have a lot more conventions at the earlier parts of the year and it was already the third time I was boothing. I love doujinfes events for their 1.8 m tables when most other conventions default to 1.2m. They also have a unique chill and cozy atmosphere that I could relax and have fun in. For this event, I adopted my friend, fishymilky as my booth partner and we combined into a glorious booth named “Laosaiya”. The house of laosai…. I hope ya’'ll get the joke. As I am boothing full-time and have an extensive collection of items, this would not be possible if doujinfes did not provide 1.8m tables. (thank you so much doujinfes)

We agreed to meet up and set up at the event around 9 am. We had plans to bring back all our items and set it up again as the event area was not going to be locked up. I decided to leave the cloths I used to close shop at home… I got up at around past 5 am, went out to get some Burger King for breakfast. Slowly ate my breakfast, did some last minute packing and headed off to the event venue.

Arriving on the dot at 9am, I slowly began to set up and my boothmate joined me shortly after. We spent the day clowning around giggling and being stupid. Catching up with friends who dropped by was great. Snacking on gifts from friends was amazing. Come 6 pm and I was already regretting leaving the close shop cloths at home. The chill atmosphere made me lazy and I didn’t want to lug all my items home and set up again. Unfortunately, past me already predicted that and wanted to force myself to do it by leaving the cloths at home. Eventually we decided to pack everything up but hide them under the table cloth. I was a little worried about things getting stolen as there were prior incidents but laziness prevails.

We had dinner at the other mall nearby, Kallang Wave Mall. It was a Korean fusion restaurant recommended to us called “OMO OMO”. Then we went prowling around looking for ice cream before we parted ways. I went home, checked the list of restocks and things I had to prepare for the next day, completed them and went to bed.

Rinse and repeat for the second day. Got up early, went to McDonnal’s to grab breakfast and headed over to the event venue. I began to set up my booth once again. My booth mate arrived shortly after and we quickly completed set up. We took the opportunity to browse the booths before the crowd came in. Another day of clowning around and chatting with friends flew by. We had Marutama ramen for dinner and when around prowling for ice cream once again.

I don’t have much photos, I’m too chilled to remember to take photos :>
