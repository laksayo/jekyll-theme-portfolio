Asia Comics Expo is a convention I had booked in a bundle set with Cosfest back in August last year. This time, the event is hosted at Suntec Convention Hall 404 as well as the Concourse Level 3. Boothers were offered an option to upgrade their package from a table within the convention hall to a booth on level 3 priced at $680. This is a ticketed event and attendees and exhibitors alike are given wrist bands (one way fastened on). I’m saying this specifically because as I was setting up, it got caught on velcro and strangled my wrist.

As this event was my first booth after the lunar new year, I prepared intensively and also launched a few new line ups of merchandise. This resulted in an all time high amount of things I was bringing to a convention. As I strolled into the hall with my baggage, I greeted many familiar faces and wished them great sales for the event. Many of my artists friends do not have great expectations for the event since the disappointment of Cosfest last year. We were all hoping that ACE would prove us wrong. Unlike previously at Cosfest, they only attached 2 booths together instead of the 5 booths in a row set up. There was also adequate space behind the tables. I’m appreciative of the improvement.

I managed to snag a helpful booth assistant for this event. Unfortunately, helper-san does not know or play the game “Love and Deepspace” and my items are 95% from that series. Before the con we cramped last minute revision so that she will be able to accurately identify and differentiate the characters. (spoiler: she did great) With my competent helper-san, I was out and about playing with friends instead of holing up at my booth. Mwehehehe.

After I arrived, I quickly brought helper-san in and finished setting up. I sent her on a journey to purchase bubble tea as well as cheki packs. I was intending to cosplay Rafayel and offer cheki services using a printer helper-san kindly offered up. The event was bustling and I visited friends who were boothing as well to chat and catch up. Everyone had cool refreshes and updates to their catalogue. I also went to snoop on friends who were doing cosplay booths. Boothing for cosplay and art seems completely different in terms of preparations as well as considerations.

Thanks to my competent helper-san, the event was very chill and comfortable for me. We closed shop a little early and headed over to Somerset to visit the Valentines’ Billboard. As it was already dark, we were not able to get any photos with decent lighting. I was kindly advised by my cosplayer boother friends to visit the billboard tomorrow (again) in the day. Helper-san and I enjoyed a nice bowl of tsuta ramen and we parted ways heading home. I got home, did the usual restocking and packing for the next day and went to bed.

The next day, I got up earlier, cosed up and headed over to the billboard once again. I was to meet helper-san before heading off for lunch and then the event. Unfortunately, the billboard had technical errors and was not showing up. There was no fate with the Billboard… I saw my cosplayer friends who also came to take photos with the billboard and informed them about the issue. We were all disappointed but as we had booths to tend to, we could not linger and wait for the billboard to turn up. Helper-san came not long after and we proceeded to suntec together. Lunch was pizza. I sent helper-san to buy bubble tea as I went to open shop…

The day passed comfortably for me once again as helper-san was so competent… Until i returned to my booth and find that helper-san has found another Laksayo to replace me in the booth!

Closing shop on time, I gathered with my friends and had dinner at our favourite korean stew restaurant, Onggii.

I had so much fun fooling around outside that I completely forgot to take pictures of my booth :<
